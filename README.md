# vimpaste
Based on wookayin/imagepaste.vim, but partially rewritten.

Allows you to copy images into vim.

Installs like normal vim extensions. The clipboard integration was a little buggy, but seems to be functional on 10.15.7, no idea why that improved. This plugin is functional.

Not compatible with Windows
